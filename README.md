# Hi, I'm Loga Mithra !! 

I'm a **Cybersecurity Student** exploring the world of ethical hacking, digital forensics, and incident response.  
Currently learning red team and blue team practices through courses, labs, and hands-on challenges.

##  What I'm Learning
- Networking
- Bash Scripting
- Ethical hacking fundamentals  
- Digital Forensics & Incident Response (DFIR) basics  
- Blue team and purple team defense strategies  

##  Featured Project
**CIPHEREYE** — a learning project focusing on detecting malicious activities in encrypted traffic without decryption: 

- Using metadata features like packet size, inter-arrival times, flow duration, and TLS handshake.
- Applying Machine Learning models (Scikit-learn) for classification.
- Leveraging Wireshark for traffic capture and dataset preparation.

**IAMpact** — a learning project focusing on detecting risky IAM behaviors and anomalous access patterns using AI-driven analytics:

- Using enriched IAM log features like user activity, login frequency, source IP reputation, and access anomalies.
- Applying Machine Learning models (Random Forest, Scikit-learn) for alert scoring and risk classification.
- Leveraging Flask backend and interactive dashboards (Chart.js) for real-time visualization and insights.

##  Skills in Progress
- Topics: Ethical Hacking, Digital Forensics, Incident Response, Network Security  
- Tools I'm learning: Burp Suite, Nmap, Wireshark, Metasploit, Autopsy, Splunk, Linux, Git

##  My Journey
Every day is a learning step — I’m actively learning and building my skills through labs, projects, and guided practice to grow into a skilled cybersecurity professional.
